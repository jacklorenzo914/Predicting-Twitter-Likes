# Predicting-Twitter-Likes
This program predicts the number of likes Lebron James will receive on a tweet using publicly available information scraped from his last 3200 tweets. These predictions use information on tweet length, hashtags time of post and other measurable structured data. In this script, we compare the performance of a linear model on all predictors against a linear model with a created interaction term, a lasso regression, random forests, and XGBoost. We compare the performance of the latter models by comparing the AUC of the different methods and conclude that XGBoost performs the best.
